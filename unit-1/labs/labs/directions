# Hello HTML!

## Objective

Learn about how to create your first HTML page.

## Learning
 
In this lab, we will be learning the basics of HTML. We will be focusing on HTML semantic tags and link tags. We will also utilize Emmet Abbreviations: shortcut key combinations that autofill content for us. Lastly, we will install the Live Server extension in order to easily view our work in the browser.

Topics:

- HTML
- HTML semantic tags
- HTML `<a href>` tag links
- VSCode Emmet Abbreviations
- VSCode Extensions

## Achieving

In this lab, we will create a basic website using HTML. It will have a layout, placeholder content, and multiple pages connected by `<a href>` links.

Your work will result in:

- A website created with HTML.
- A website laid out utilizing semantic div tags.
- A website that has placeholder content.
- A website that has multiple pages navigable by `<a href>` links.

## Procedure

### Creating `hello-html` and `index.html`

- [x] Create a directory named `hello-html`.
- [x] Inside of `hello-html`, create a file named `index.html`.

### Using the `!` HTML Emet Abbreviation

- [x] Inside of `index.html`, type `!` and press `Enter`.
- [x] This should create an empty HTML template for you to use.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    
</body>
</html>
```

### Installing the Live Server Extension

- [x] In VScode, navigate to your extensions and search Live Server. The correct extension is the first result.
- [x] Install Live Server.
- [x] Close VSCode and then reopen it again.
- [x] Along the bottom bar on the right side, you should now have a button that says 'Go Live'.
- [x] Click the 'Go Live' button to launch your website locally. It's important to note that you should only click the 'Go Live' button when you are in `index.html`.

### Creating our HTML Layout

- [x] Your tags to create this layout will live inside of the `<body>` tag pair. This is true for every website you build.
- [x] Your `<title>` tag should contain the name of the page. (Home, in this case).
- [x] In our website, we will need the following semantic div tags: `<header>`, `<nav>`, and `<main>`. Be sure to include their closing tag.

### Filling out placeholder content

- [x] `<header>` Should contain a title for the page.
- [x] `<nav>`Should contain at least three``s that will navigate to other pages on the site. Leave them blank for now.
- [x] `<main>` Should contain placeholder text and `<img>`s.
- [x] To generate placeholder text in VSCode, type `lorem100` and push `Enter`. This will generate 100 words of placeholder text. You can change 100 to be whatever amount of words you want. `lorem5000` is also valid.
- [x] To access placeholder images, here are a few options to try: [Lorem Flickr](https://loremflickr.com/), [Placekitten](https://placekitten.com/). [Lorem Picsum](https://picsum.photos/).

### Creating multiple pages

- [x] In the same directory as `index.html`, create another file named `about.html`
- [x] In `about.html`, use the emet abbreviation again to generate the necessary HTML boiler plate.
- [x] Inside of `<body>`, put in a `<p>` tag to inform us of which page we are on (About, in this case.)
- [x] Create two more pages in the exact fashion you created `about.html`. These are your unique invention and should have unique names.
- [x] Don't forget to change the `<title>` tag content to reflect which page the user is on.

### Linking to our new pages

- [x] Back in `index.html`,  return to the `<a href>`s in `<nav>`.
- [x] For the first `<a href>`, point the link to `/about.html`. Name this link "About".
- [x] Fill out the other two `<a href>`s so that they correspond to the two additional pages that you created.

## Review

The software should:

- Have a Home page the user lands on.
- The home page should contain the `<header>`, `<nav>`, and `<main>` semantic divs filled out with placeholder content.
- Have multiple pages that can all be navigated to via the links in `<nav>`.

## Going Further

- Add `<a href>`s to your additional pages that allow the user to navigate back to the Home page.
- Add different placeholder content to your additional pages. Utilize different semantic tags than those initially given.
- Style your `<a href>`s to appear as buttons rather than links. You can research **inline styles** to do this. This will be bringing in CSS.
- Style all of your semantic tags utilizing inline styles.
